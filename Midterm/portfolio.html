                <p>In this assignment, I designed and styled a multi-page website for a fitness company,
                    'Forward Focus Fitness'. The website consisted of five pages: Home, About, Services, Membership, and
                    Contact. I used HTML to structure each page and applied CSS through an external stylesheet to ensure
                    a consistent, visually appealing design. Key elements included navigation links across all pages,
                    headers, footers, and image integration. I also validated the HTML and CSS files using the W3C
                    Markup and CSS Validation Services to ensure the code was error-free and met web standards.</p>

                        target="_blank">Project 2</a></h2>
                <p>In this assignment, I built a personal website using HTML and CSS, which included a Home page with a
                    biography, a Portfolio page showcasing my projects, and a Contact page with a form and
                    social media links. I added images and a navigation menu to link all the pages together. CSS was
                    used to style the site and ensure its responsiveness on different screen sizes.</p>

                        target="_blank">Project 3</a></h2>
                <p>In this assignment, I enhanced a bakery's website by incorporating images and links to improve its
                    visual appeal and functionality. I added four images of the bakery's products, ensuring appropriate
                    file names and alt attributes for accessibility. I also included links to the bakery's social media
                    accounts and created an internal link for easier navigation within the page. To organize the layout,
                    I used elements to separate the header, main content, and footer sections.</p>
