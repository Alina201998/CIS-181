00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.120
fun fact planet Earth is 4.5 billion

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:10.679
years old mankind about 140,000 years

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.759
old let me put that in perspective if

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.360
you condense the Earth's lifespan into

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.160
24 hours that's one full day than we

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.480
have been here on this planet for drum

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.840
roll

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.240
please 3

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.880
seconds 3 seconds and look what we've

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.039
done we have modestly named ourselves

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.000
Homo sapiens meaning wise men man but is

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.760
man really so wise smart yes and it's

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
good to be smart but not too smart for

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.920
your own

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.879
good yes we have split the atom yes we

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.120
build clever machines that navigate the

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.520
universe in search of new homes but at

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.039
the same time those atoms we split

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
created nuclear warfare in our quest to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.399
explore the Galaxy Rejects and neglects

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.920
the home that we have here now so no

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.440
that cannot be

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.280
wisdom wisdom is different while

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.000
intelligence speaks wisdom listens and

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.360
we willingly covered our ears to Mother

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.840
Nature's screams and closed our eyes to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.880
all of her help wanted signs wisdom

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.400
knows that every action has an equal and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.439
opposite reaction so if we were wise we

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.320
would not be shocked when we see storms

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.479
that are stronger than ever before or

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.159
more drought hurricanes and Wildfire

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.320
than ever before because there's more

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.759
pollution than ever before more carbon

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.560
more trees cut down than ever before at

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.960
a record Pace we have increased the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.200
extinction of animals by 1,000 times the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.600
normal rate what a feat in the next 10

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.680
to 100 years every beloved animal

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.159
character in every children's book is

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.960
predicted to go extinct Lion's gone

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.240
rhinos gone tiger gorilla elephant polar

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.320
bear gone in 3

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.200
seconds species that have been here

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.159
longer than us will be gone because of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.200
us in this 3 seconds in an existence

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.320
shorter than a Vine video we turn the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.960
circle of life into our own personal

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.119
conveyor belt somebody anybody help we

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280
were given so much the only planet in

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.960
this solar system with life I mean we

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.440
are one in a million no actually

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.959
scientifically We Are One in a billion

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.680
trillion trillion that's a one followed

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.920
by 33 zeros and I don't want to get too

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.920
spiritual but how are we not a miracle

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.280
we are perfectly positioned to the Sun

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.800
so we don't burn but not too distant so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.959
we don't turn to ice goldilock said it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.959
best we are just right this paradise

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.519
where we are given medicine from trees

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.920
not coincidentally but because the song

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.480
says We Are Family literally everything

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.959
every species is connected genetically

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.959
from the sunflower to the Sunfish and

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.200
this is what we must recognize before

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.159
it's too late because the real crisis is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.760
not global warming environmental

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.280
destruction or animal agriculture it is

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.840
us these problems are symptoms of us

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.519
byproducts of us are inner reflection

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.560
loss of connection is created this

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.440
misdirection we have forgotten that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.440
everything contributes to the Perfection

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.519
of Mother Nature Corporation ations keep

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.319
us unaware and disconnected but they

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.519
have underestimated our strength

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.480
contrary to popular belief millions are

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.080
waking up out of their sleep seeing our

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.760
home being taken right up under our feet

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.840
we cannot allow our history to be

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.840
written by the wicked greedy and Looney

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.959
it is our duty to protect Mother Nature

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.879
from those who refuse to see her beauty

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.720
call me crazy but I believe we should

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.879
have the right to eat food that's safe

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.959
with ingredients we can pronounce drink

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.200
water that is clean Marvel at trees

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.120
breathe air free of toxins these are

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.319
natural rights not things that can be

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.159
bargained for in Congress see they want

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.840
you to feel powerless but it has been

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.000
said that something as small as the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.319
flutter of a butterflies Wing can cause

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.280
a typhoon Halfway Around the World well

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.280
when enough people come together we too

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.879
will make waves and wash the world into

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.920
a new era fill with love and connection

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.159
freedom for all without oppression but

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.439
it is up to you yes you watching this

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.680
behind this screen to make the effort

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.920
because time is of the essence and only

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.920
together can we make it to the fourth

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.920
second

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:25.629
